        <h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuden is one of my absolute all-time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why in this review of mine.</p>
            <p>First of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuden is the darker tone, the maturity, and the depth in Shippuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage, being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke.</p>
            <p>Naruto's goofiness was endearing to me, but in Shippuden, he becomes serious. series as well. Now friendship and loyalty take over. The mysteries get their answers, and new questions take form.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and just as easy to hate. Surprisingly, those who love One Piece love it for the same reasons that others despise it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all play a role in both camps.This review's goal is neither to convince you to love One Piece nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views on the series.</p>
            <p> I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don't, please don't discount it for any reason until you've actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn't really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable.</p>

            <h3 >Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
            <hr width="30%" size="3" color="#f9844a" align="left" NOSHADE>

            </video>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jujutsu Kaisen is unlike any other anime I have seen before. When I first saw the trailer for it, I thought that it was not really my style, as it seemed like a horror anime with obscure powers and weird monsters. Although Jujutsu Kaisen is this to a point, it is so much more. As it does focus on the premise of curses, you can expect a horror aspect to this anime, which may not be your cup of tea, but trust me, there is so much to offer in this anime.</p>
            <p>I have never had characters in a series I have enjoyed as much as I do in Jujustu Kaisen. The trio of Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisake are downright perfect. Yuji Itadori's comical presence pairs perfectly with Megumi Fushiguro's flare and Nobara Kugisake's spunk, making this trio some of my favorite characters of all time. Then add Saturo Gojo as their teacher and, oh my god, you have some of the best protagonists ever, and Sukuna and Suguru Geto have the makings of being A-tier antagonists as well.</p>
            <p>Another incredible thing about Jujutsu Kaisen is its animation. It is absolutely stunning. My mouth dropped at some of the fight scenes because of how beautiful they were, and the fight scenes are unlike any I have seen before. They are just spectacular.</p>

            </video>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ousama Ranking is perfection, more than subjectivity and the classic tale of what it means to be an underestimated underdog's rise to success. I'd think that there's a better way to sum up this show as a whole, and that's by starting and ending with metaphors. See, this show has laid the hidden meaning of "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link", and putting this in Ousama Ranking's context, it realistically sums it up as: "You're as strong as your weakest link." There is not a single shred of doubt in my mind that Ousama Ranking will be remembered for months and years to come, and it's the new, modern classic of jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring motivation at its finest.</p>

        <h3>Your Name</h3>
        <hr width="30%" size="3" color="#f9844a" align="left" NOSHADE>
        <video controls width="426" height="240" poster="../IMAGES/Your Name.jpg">
            <source src="../FILMS/MOVIES/Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) Trailer.mp4">
        </video>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Name" is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever, in my opinion.</p>
        <p>The animation in "Your Name" is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and is explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersion, and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well-realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.</p>

        <h3>Weathering With You</h3>

        </video>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All round, it was another amazing story from Makoto Shinkai about not just the two main characters but all the characters involved. </p>
        <p>The depth of the supporting characters and how each of them interacted really blew me away. All of the characters' actions felt true to their personalities, and it was incredibly warming to see each of the characters grow in some way. As we learned new information about each of the characters, it helped us understand why they had some of their personality traits. This was especially evident with Keisuke.</p>
        <p>The art style was gorgeous, as always from Shinkai, and the music fit perfectly. The lack of an OP didn't take away from the experience at all, and I can never find an issue with the RADWIMPS style in comparison to the story.</p>

        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>

        </video>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirited Away (2001) by Hayao Miyazaki is a magical film that you should not miss. He builds a stunning setting that makes you feel like you're advancing alongside the character throughout the film, and he portrays a feeling of space via time, distance, and size.
        </p>
        <p>There are several situations where the characters simply exist and nothing substantial occurs, which is brilliant. "If you have nonstop action with no breathing room at all, it's simply business," Hayao Miyazaki explains. However, if you take a minute to think about it, the tension that is developing in the picture might expand into a new dimension. "Ma" is the name of this approach.</p>
        <p>The film is classified as an animation/drama and centers on the themes of a child's innocence, boldness, and unconditional love.</p>

        <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
        <hr width="30%" size="3" color="#f9844a" align="left" NOSHADE>
        <video controls width="426" height="240" poster="../IMAGES/Howl's.jpg">
            <source src="../FILMS/MOVIES/Howl no Ugoku Shiro.mp4">
        </video>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howl's Moving Castle is another wonderful animation from Japan's Studio Ghibli, a children's cartoon that proves to be a moving, inventive, and utterly imaginative experience for kids and adults alike. To describe it too much would be to spoil the fun; suffice to say, this is a film packed with incidents and insights, with engaging characters and larger-than-life situations.</p>
        <p>This time around, it's an anti-war feature, with war providing the backdrop to the central tale. The character of the young girl who is transformed through witchcraft into an old woman is an intriguing one, and the titular castle is a superbly animated creation. I particularly liked the supporting characters in this film: Disney usually makes the characters that support the protagonists irritating in the extreme, but here they're quite brilliant: the bounding scarecrow, the living fire, even the Witch of the Wastes.</p>
